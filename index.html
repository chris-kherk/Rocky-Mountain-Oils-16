                <p>
                    The heart chakra, also known as the <i>Anahata</i> chakra or green chakra, is the energetic center for unconditional love, compassion, kindness, and forgiveness. Balancing your heart chakra can help you radiate more love for yourself and others. When you work with this chakra, you can truly "follow your heart" and navigate the world with greater empathy, openness, and acceptance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But before we explore the <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/products/heart-chakra-roll-on">heart chakra</a>, let’s take a moment to review some chakra fundamentals. You may have heard the term “chakra” in a yoga class or guided meditation yet feel unclear about its meaning. In Sanskrit, chakra means “wheel” or “disk.” The concept of chakras was first recorded in ancient Indian spiritual texts called the Vedas and Tantras, which date back to 1500 BC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to this metaphysical tradition, chakras are centers within the body that govern the flow of our prana (also known as life-force energy or chi). When this energy is imbalanced, it can disrupt our mental, physical, and spiritual well-being. Chakras maintain the correct balance and ensure that our energy flows correctly – not too much or too little. Even if you aren’t spiritual, chakras can be a useful metaphor to bring greater balance and tranquility to your life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there are many chakras, most energetic healing practices focus on the primary system of seven chakras located along the spine. They begin at the tailbone and extend upward to the crown of the head. Each chakra is associated with specific emotions, personality traits, and physical conditions. They also have a specific color, scent, mantras or affirmations, and crystals associated with them.

Our energy can overflow or become stagnant, leading to various problems in our life. "Balancing the chakras" means focusing on each specific chakra to optimize its function.

                <h3>Anahata: The Heart Chakra or Fourth Chakra</h3>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, the heart chakra is located in the "heart space" in the center of your ribcage. It's the fourth of the seven primary chakras and is sometimes called the green chakra due to its connection with the color green. In Sanskrit, it is called the Anahata chakra, which means "unhurt, unstruck, and unbeaten."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Love is the central force of this chakra. It is said to govern compassion for the self and others, as well as empathy, forgiveness, gratitude, appreciation, and fondness. When properly aligned, the heart chakra helps you love unconditionally, feel a stronger emotional connection to others, and create space for different perspectives without judgment. It can also help you develop deeper relationships with your loved ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An open heart heart chakra also promotes emotional stability. It helps you act selflessly while maintaining healthy, loving boundaries and acting with greater integrity in relationships. This helps you be a more generous partner, family member, and friend. When balanced, your heart chakra also helps you attract the right people and situations to support your greatest dreams.
                </p>

                    To align your heart chakra, begin by identifying whether it's underactive or overactive.
                </p>
                <h4>Underactive Heart Chakra</h4>
                <p>
                    When a chakra is underactive, it means there’s a blockage or restriction disrupting the flow of energy through it. An underactive heart chakra can affect your overall well-being, especially with regard to your emotional health. You may feel judgmental, distant from others, or unable to let go of resentments and perceived slights. You may also feel numb to expressions of love and compassion.
                </p>
                <h4>Signs of an underactive heart chakra:</h4>
                <p>
                    Your heart chakra may be blocked if you are experiencing...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeling withdrawn from the world around you</li>
                    <li>Unable to access emphathy or understanding for others</li>
                    <li>An inability to forgive</li>
                    <li>Feelings of isolation</li>
                    <li>Feelings overly critical of yourself</li>
                    <li>Feelings overly critical of others</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Overactive Heart Chakra</h4>
                <p>
                    When a chakra is overactive, it means it is distributing too much energy. An overactive heart chakra affects your discernment in relationships and leaves you emotionally drained. You may find yourself over-committing, saying "yes" when you mean to say "no", or falling into toxic emotional patterns. You may also feeli like your emotions are out of control. 
                </p>
                <h4>Signs of an overactive heart chakra:</h4>
                <p>
                    Your heart chakra may be too open if you feel...
                </p>

                    <li>Codependency</li>
                    <li>Putting others ahead of yourself</li>
                    <li>Losing your sense of identity in a relationship</li>
                    <li>An inability to express boundaries</li>
                    <li>Saying "yes" even when it negatively affects you</li>
                    <li>Giving too much to others without taking care of yourself</li>
